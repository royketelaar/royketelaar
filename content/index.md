# Roy Ketelaar

## Front-end Developer

I am a frontend developer with a background in web design. I love learning new things, working with people and building applications that users find useful.

I work from a Design Thinking perspective, i.e. first understanding the user and putting yourself in their position before actually starting the work.

Outside of work, I like experiencing new things and traveling to cool places.
