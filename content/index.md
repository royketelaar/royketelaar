## Front-end Developer

Hi there, my name is Roy Ketelaar. I am a frontend developer with a background in web design. I love learning new things, working with people and building applications that users find useful. I enjoy the process of trial-and-error, optimizing, and creating a good user experience.

To make this happen, I think from a Design Thinking perspective, i.e. first understanding the user and putting yourself in their position before actually starting the work. Outside of work, I like experiencing new things, traveling to cool places and maintaining an active lifestyle 🏋🏻🥾
